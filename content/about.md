I'm Alex Wolkoff, a State College based software engineer, tech enthusiast, and reader, who never stops learning. I am currently studying Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations, at the Pennsylvania State University (**WE ARE!**). Below are some projects that I've been working on.

I'm also a photographer that got their start taking pictures of flowers and plant life, but I am starting to fall in love with capturing joy on people's faces. [Click here] to see my photos
